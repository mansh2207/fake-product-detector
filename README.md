![Screenshot (22)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7491708a-a54f-4852-803a-7e84dceef40b)


The **ProductAuthentication** smart contract aims to create a decentralized and transparent system for authenticating products. By storing product details such as serial numbers, manufacturers, and timestamps on the blockchain, it helps combat counterfeiting and provides customers with a reliable method for verifying product authenticity. This solution fosters trust between manufacturers and consumers by ensuring that product information is immutable and accessible.

## Flowchart

```plaintext
+-------------------+
|                   |
|  Register Product |
|                   |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v

|                   |
|   Product Stored  |  -----> Mapped by Serial Number
|                   |
+---------+---------+
          |
          v
+---------+---------+
|                   |
| Verify Product    |
|                   |
+---------+---------+
```

### Flow:

1. **Register Product**:  
   The manufacturer registers a product by inputting its name, manufacturer, and serial number. This data is securely stored on the blockchain.
   
2. **Product Stored**:  
   The product's information is mapped by its serial number and saved on the blockchain, ensuring immutability.
   
3. **Verify Product**:  
   Users can verify a product by providing its serial number. The contract will return the productâ€™s details if it is found.
